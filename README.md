# detecting_and_denoising_EEG_artifacts
Public repo to demonstrate some code I wrote for a previous project replicating the results of https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130669. As this was a group project where the replication of the deep neural network which denoised the EEG data included others' code, I post here just the preprocessing pipeline that I wrote myself.
